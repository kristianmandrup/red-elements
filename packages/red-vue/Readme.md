# red-vue

> node-red Vue components and showcase app

## Architecture

See [Architecture](https://github.com/tecla5/red-elements/blob/master/Readme.md) for details on internal design and architecture.

## Commands

You can replace `yarn` with `npm run` here.

```bash
# build for production
yarn build

# development mode
yarn dev

# run unit tests
yarn test

# serve the bundled dist folder in production mode
yarn serve
```

## Polyfills

By default we only polyfill `window.Promise` and `Object.assign`. You can add more polyfills in `./src/polyfills.js`.

## Code splitting

As webpack supports both [dynamic import](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting-async/#dynamic-import-import-) and [`require.ensure`](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting-async/#require-ensure-) syntax, we would recommend you to stick to `require.ensure` for now because of [performance issue](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/4636).

## Analyze bundle size

Run `yarn report` to get a report of bundle size which helps you:

- Realize what's really inside your bundle
- Find out what modules make up the most of it's size
- Find modules that got there by mistake
- Optimize it!


## Test

You can use [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) to run tests, basically the default setup is based on AVA's offical [Vue.js recipe](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/docs/recipes/vue.md).

Check out `./test/test.js` for an example test case, and `./test/helpers/setup.js` for how we transform `.vue` and `.js` files.
